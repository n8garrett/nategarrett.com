<h1>About</h1>

<p>My enjoyment in web development comes from my interest in business, design, and technology. Working as a web developer allows me to get to know the business, it's goals, and use my design and technical skills to develop user-friendly solutions.</p>
<p>Currently I serve as a web developer at the <a href="https://soic.iupui.edu">IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI</a>.</p>

<h2>Where it all started</h2>

<p>I started building websites in high school, teaching myself HTML by looking at the source code of other websites. Using my newfound skills, I created a website for my high school cross country team and a pro wrestling news website.</p>
<p>After high school, I earned a <a href="https://informatics.indiana.edu">Bachelor of Science in Informatics</a> and a <a href="https://ils.indiana.edu">Masters in Information Science</a>, both from Indiana University.</p>
<h2>Service and Sports</h2>
<p>It's not all work and no play. I enjoy staying active by running, hiking, and playing softball and basketball.</p>
<p>Playing sports was a huge part of my childhood and I enjoy helping provide kids the same fun opportunities I had as a kid. I coach baseball for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FTLightningBaseball/">Franklin Township Lightning</a>. I am also certified by Driveline in Youth Baseball Development.</p>
<p>Previously I have coached in local basketball and soccer leagues in Franklin Township and coached and served on the board of directors for the Franklin Township Rookie League.</p>
<p>In addition to sports, I'm active in the <a href="https://rlcindy.org/hunger/">hunger ministries</a> and lead the Web Team at Resurrection Lutheran Church.</p>
