# About

My enjoyment in web development comes from my interest in business, design, and technology. Working as a web developer allows me to get to know the business, itâ€™s goals, and use my design and technical skills to develop user-friendly solutions.

Currently I serve as a web developer at the [IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI](https://soic.iupui.edu).

## Where it all started

I started building websites in high school, teaching myself HTML by looking at the source code of other websites. Using my newfound skills, I managed a pro wrestling website that generated over 1,000 visits per day while in high school.

After high school, I earned a [Bachelor of Science in Informatics](https://informatics.indiana.edu) and a [Masters in Information Science](https://ils.indiana.edu), both from Indiana University.

## Service and Sports

It's not all work and no play. I enjoy staying active by running, hiking, and playing softball and basketball.

Playing sports was a huge part of my childhood and I enjoy helping provide kids the same fun opportunities I had as a kid. I coach baseball for the [Franklin Township Lightning](https://www.facebook.com/FTLightningBaseball/). I am also certified by Driveline in Youth Baseball Development.

Previously I have coached in local basketball and soccer leagues in Franklin Township and coached and served on the board of directors for the [Franklin Township Rookie League](http://ftrlbaseball.com).

In addition to sports, I'm active in the [hunger ministries](https://rlcindy.org/hunger/) and lead the Web Team at Resurrection Lutheran Church.
