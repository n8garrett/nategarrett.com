# About

I have 15 years of experience creating websites for higher education, nonprofits, and individuals. I currently work for the [IU School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI](https://soic.iupui.edu) as a web developer.

In my role at IUPUI, I enjoy living on the edge between user experience design, especially my interest in information architecture and development (front-end, PHP/WordPress).

## Where it all started

My interest in web development dates back to high school where I taught myself HTML and Perl. Using my newfound skills, I managed a pro wrestling website that generated over 1,000 visits per day while in high school.

After high school, I earned a [Bachelor of Science in Informatics](https://informatics.iupui.edu) and a [Masters in Information Science](https://ils.indiana.edu), both from Indiana University.

## Service and Sports

Itâ€™s not all work and no play. I enjoy running and playing softball and basketball.

I am active in many youth sports leagues where I coach baseball, basketball, and soccer. I also serve on the board of directors for the Franklin Township Rookie League and as a travel baseball coach for the Franklin Township Lightning.

Outside of sports, I contribute my time and talents to [hunger ministries](https://rlcindy.org/hunger/) and lead the Web Team at Resurrection Lutheran Church.
